# Rasa-Kotlin

This is an **experimental** API client library for JVM written in Kotlin. It can be used in Kotlin or Java projects (and
in the future, also in JavaScript or Kotlin Native).

At the moment the library is **not** production ready. There are still a lot of missing commands and API definition is 
still heavily changing.
